# Vehicle-License-Plate-Recognition
The project is about Vehicle License plate Recognition with OpenCV &amp; Python

Day by day the number of vehicle is increasing everywhere, so the system is necessary to manage the movements and other security issues.
Here KNN algorithm is used to find the the maching of possible combination of our desire license plate part from image.

We know that a vehicle license plate number is consists of Alphabets from A to Z and Number from 0 to 9. So, when we will train data we will make 5 different fonts for each alphabet and number.

In the preprocessing part we convert the color image to GrayScale image then threshold image for our convenience in image processing.

The accuracy of this project is about 90%
